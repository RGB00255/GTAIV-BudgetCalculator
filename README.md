# GTAIV-BudgetCalculator
	
SO, you are using FusionFix, you installed some mods and are having the taxi bug. This can be fixed in "<path-to-game>\GTAIV\plugins\GTAIV.EFLC.FusionFix.ini" by setting "VehicleBudget" to 260000000. If you would rather calculate the exact value yourself you are welcome to try this batch file.
	
# Instructions
  
  1. Download BudgetCalculator.bat
  2. Place in "<path-to-game>\GTAIV" (where GTAIV.exe is)
  3. Run BudgetCalculator.bat
  4. Put your output value in the VehicleBudget line in "<path-to-game>\GTAIV\plugins\GTAIV.EFLC.FusionFix.ini"
